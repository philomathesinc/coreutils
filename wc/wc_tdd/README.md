# GNU `wc`

## Scope
- Iteratively work on the following, making sure that the wc package implements the functionality without tying it to a CLI.
- Mark each point done after adding test cases.

### Outputs
- [ ] Count of lines - `wc -l testdata/one.txt`
- [ ] Count of words - `wc -w testdata/one.txt`
- [ ] Count of characters - `wc -c testdata/one.txt`
- [ ] All flags - `wc -l -w -c testdata/one.txt`
- [ ] No flags - `wc testdata/one.txt`
- [ ] Combined flags - `wc -lcw testdata/one.txt`
- [ ] Any combination of flags - `wc -lcw testdata/one.txt`
- [ ] Any order for flags or args - `wc -l testdata/one.txt` == `wc testdata/one.txt -l`

### Inputs
- [ ] Single file
- [ ] Multiple file
- [ ] Standard input

    ```
    wc --help
    Usage: wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
      or:  wc [OPTION]... --files0-from=F
    Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if
    more than one FILE is specified.  A word is a non-zero-length sequence of
    printable characters delimited by white space.

    With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

    The options below may be used to select which counts are printed, always in
    the following order: newline, word, character, byte, maximum line length.
      -c, --bytes            print the byte counts
      -m, --chars            print the character counts
      -l, --lines            print the newline counts
          --files0-from=F    read input from the files specified by
                              NUL-terminated names in file F;
                              If F is - then read names from standard input
      -L, --max-line-length  print the maximum display width
      -w, --words            print the word counts
