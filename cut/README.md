# GNU `cut`

## Scope

Iteratively working on the following.

### Inputs
- [ ] Implement fields flag with delimiter - `--fields=LIST --delimiter=DELIM`
- [ ] Implement characters flag - `--characters=LIST`
- [ ] Implement bytes flag - `--bytes=LIST`

### Outputs
- [ ] Implement output delimiter - `--output-delimiter=STRING`
- [ ] Implement output filtering - `--only-delimited`, `--complement`

## Development

If using VSCode, you can go to the Run and Debug screen to Debug the code in various ways.

1. Using the VSCode window to launch the program using different args - Check the [`.vscode/launch.json`](./.vscode/launch.json) to check the different configurations. For example - "Colon;Fields=1", "Tab;Fields=1", etc.

2. Using a separate terminal to launch the binary and debugging in the VSCode window. For this to work, you have to build the binary and then execute using these commands.
    ```
    go build -gcflags=all="-N -l" .

    # Assuming your binary is called `cut`
    # Pass any flags you want to your program after the `--`(double hyphen)
    dlv exec --api-version 2 --headless -l 127.0.0.1:2345 ./cut -- -f 1 testdata/lists.txt
    ```

2. Usage info via `cut --help`
    ```
    Usage: cut OPTION... [FILE]...
    Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.

    With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

    Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
    -b, --bytes=LIST        select only these bytes
    -c, --characters=LIST   select only these characters
    -d, --delimiter=DELIM   use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter
    -f, --fields=LIST       select only these fields;  also print any line
                                that contains no delimiter character, unless
                                the -s option is specified
    -n                      (ignored)
        --complement        complement the set of selected bytes, characters
                                or fields
    -s, --only-delimited    do not print lines not containing delimiters
        --output-delimiter=STRING  use STRING as the output delimiter
                                the default is to use the input delimiter
    -z, --zero-terminated    line delimiter is NUL, not newline
        --help        display this help and exit
        --version     output version information and exit

    Use one, and only one of -b, -c or -f.  Each LIST is made up of one
    range, or many ranges separated by commas.  Selected input is written
    in the same order that it is read, and is written exactly once.
    Each range is one of:

    N     N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1
    N-    from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line
    N-M   from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field
    -M    from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field
